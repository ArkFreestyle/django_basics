# django_basics
Code I've written following the Django documentation tutorials.

The tutorials ([which can be found here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/)) take you through building a basic polling application. Along the way you practice building views, models, interact with Django's database API, use and personalize the admin site, learn about the template system, generic views, forms, static files and testing your application. They are extremely well-written and each tutorial offers resources on where you can learn more about a particular topic.

Definitely recommend going through them if you're interested in Django!
